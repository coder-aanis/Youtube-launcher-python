# Youtube-launcher-python
This is just a simple python script that directly opens youtube homepage on your default browser AND enters fullscreen.
You can use the icon file to change the icon. I use it on the numix launcher bar, so it looks cool anyway.
First project, and it's really noob.
*Python3 REQUIRED*
install "pynput" using pip3 install pynput command in cmd (windows)
